# Task-Web-Application-Project

## What is the purpose of this project

The purpose of creating thr web application is create a task list that enables me to do my best in managing my workload. Also, it's an application which I can definitely use for any projects such as DevOps tools by using this application as an example.  

## What your application does

The project aims to design a website application that allows the users like myself to create a task list to increase knowledge of knowing what needs to be completed. This design also enables the users the ability to create a seperate task list for work related tasks and home related tasks by using different user accounts. The workflow of the user accounts is that they can first click on the "Sign-up" button as we know their account wouldn't exist on the database. After entering the details on the sign-up form below, it adds the details onto the database file named "accounts.db".

Next, the user clicks on the login button and they enter the email address and password which they used on the sign-up page. Clicked on the login button and it displayed the homepage which was known as the task page below:

Inside the homepage, it gives the users the ability to add tasks that they want to accomplish throughout the day or week. This can be done by writing the task and then clicking on the add task button.

The user can also remove task by clicking on the cross button on the side to remove task.

When a user needs to sign in to another user account to create a seperate task list, they can just click on the logout button and it will re-direct them to the login page.

## Technologies used

The following technologies used are:

* Python
* HTML (Hyper-Text-Markup-Language)
* JavaScript

The reason why I used python is because it's an important skill for me to learn in the long-term. Also, I personally find writing python code/scripts interesting as I get the opportunity to explore different libaries. This project is the first time I am learning about python flask. 

HTML and JavaScript is a skill I have learned previously in Uxbridge college during HND Level 5 in Computing and it's a skill which is good to refresh on as that helped massively on how website applications are created.

## Challenges faced:

The challenges I faced with this project is creating a function that helps me remnove a task from the list after adding it because I faced issues with the index.js file and also within the home.html itself with not accepting the syntax which is supported by python. 

## Potential improvements to the web application

One of the improvements I want to focus on is migrating the backend from using SQLite to MySQL server. Eventually I want to migrate the entire web application into the cloud using different services and tools.

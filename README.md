# Task-Web-Application-Project

## What is the purpose of this project

The goal of making this web app is to have a task list that helps me manage my work efficiently. I can also use this app as a model for other projects, like DevOps tools.

## What your application does

The project's goal is to create a website app that helps users like me make task lists for better organization. Users can have separate lists for work and home tasks with different accounts. To get started, users click "Sign-up," adding their details to the "accounts.db" database after filling out the form.

Afterward, the user selects the login button and enters the email and password from the sign-up. This action leads to the homepage, referred to as the task page.

On the homepage, users can easily input tasks they need to complete within the day or week. They simply write the task and click "Add Task."

The user can also remove task by clicking on the cross button on the side to remove task.

When a user needs to sign in to another user account to create a seperate task list, they can just click on the logout button and it will re-direct them to the login page.

## Technologies used

The technologies used include:

* Python
* HTML
* JavaScript

I chose Python because it's valuable for my long-term growth, and I enjoy exploring its libraries while coding. This project is my first encounter with Python Flask.

I previously learned HTML and JavaScript during my HND Level 5 in Computing at Uxbridge College. Refreshing these skills is important as they greatly contributed to my understanding of creating web applications.

## Challenges faced:

I encountered challenges while working on this project. One difficulty was creating a function to remove tasks from the list after adding them. I faced issues with the index.js file and also within the home.html, where the syntax supported by Python wasn't accepted.

## Potential improvements to the web application

I aim to enhance the project by shifting the backend from SQLite to MySQL server. Furthermore, I plan to move the entire web app to the cloud, utilizing various services and tools.
